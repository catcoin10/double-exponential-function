# double-exponential-function

This is a program designed to use the double exponential function (10^10^x) as a more precise form of scientific notation. Not only can it display more numbers, it can also go higher in terms of numbers stored (though that is not the point of this program).

I have an introduction to double exponential function: inputting 0 gets you to 10, 1 gets you to ten billion, and 2 gets you to a googol (a number larger than anything you can imagine in real life), and so on. In case you're curious about negative numbers, -1 gets you approximately five-fourths. But negative numbers are not implemented (though I could implement them later on, it wouldn't be too hard.
